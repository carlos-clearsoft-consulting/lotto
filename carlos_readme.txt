To initialize the system with data:
1. upload lotto649.csv, lottomax.csv and bc49.csv to server.  These come from https://www.playnow.com/lottery/lotto-649-winning-numbers/ as a download for example.
2. run importlotto.py with each of lotto649, lottomax, bc49
3. run generateMatchingPairsTriplets.py, which does all 3 lotteries automatically
